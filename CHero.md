# C-hero-app
Mobile application developed for students to learn C programming language from the beginning.

Introduction

The technology in modern day world keeps on developing where various types of innovations are 
published from various parts of the world. Even the software, systems used for devices are much 
more advanced. The main reason to develop our app because even the infants try to use a mobile 
device and during the pandemic era children of all ages tend more to use smart devices. Therefore 
considering all these facts we thought of developing an application where students can learn about 
the coding parts which are used in all these devices. So we will be developing the application 
“C Hero”. Where students in any age can learn about coding in an interesting way. Write a simple 
code ,run it and see whether it works.

The user can register to our application. Maintain his profile. This application is a game which has 
different levels. From level 1 to 20. From printing a simple “Hello world” statement to higher levels. 
At the completion of each stage he/she will be awarded with points stating his experience in coding. 
Here they will not be typing any coding part, there will be pre built coding parts to be drag and drop 
for the user to place the correct part in the appropriate section. App will check the dropped coding 
parts and display the progress of the user. User will only be given several chances. If not completed
 successfully in the given chances no points will be awarded.

Also here user can learn about the programming language and start the game. There will be tutorials
 for the user to learn. User’s knowledge on the tutorials will also be recorded as he keeps on reading 
them. The language that we will be focusing is C program. 

The four main functions that we have implemented are :-
•	User login and register management
•	User profile management
•	Game level management
•	Tutorial management.
